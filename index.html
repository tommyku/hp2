            My internship at Compass was my first time returning to California after finishing my exchange
            to UC Davis, CA during Winter 2016. My friends Alan and Harrison were interns at Compass during
            2015 and 2016 summer respectively, and they were there at Compass when Cyberport accepted me into the
            Digital Tech Internship Programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was 2 rounds of technical interviews through Skype, then I received an offer! A summer in Silicon
            Valley working as an intern in a then-recently acquired tech company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of 3 months there were lots of wtf moments trying to navigate a micro-service based
            system and to single-handedly build a feature from beginning to end. Plus a bit of tinkering around
            fixing small bugs and making changes. Then there was code review in which rejection was a commonplace.
            I sometimes ended up having to rewrite the whole feature due to miscommunication and change in scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experience in Compass taught me how bad a designer I am, and how good a programmer I could be if I
            throw in enough of considerations. I saw how to structure a micro-service based system. And I saw
            the charm in seniors when their solutions were far superior than mine. Although my achievements
            in Compass were not as many as in EventXtra, it effectively crushed my then-bloated ego, and reminded
            me to "be humble" because there are infinitely many people out there doing a better job than I do.
