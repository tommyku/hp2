            I joined JP Morgan as a technology analyst on August 2018, working under Corporate &amp; Investment Banking.
            This is my first time working at a international corporation (discounting Compass...it's under Sage Group
            but remained as a standalone unit), so far the experience has been exciting and rewarding.

            In the summer of 2017, I was a senior year student at HKUST, still qualify for a last bit of internship
            before jumping into the workforce. I was glad to be accepted into the Cyberport Digital Tech Internship
            Programme, which eventually led me to 3 months at Compass in San Francisco.

            Two friends of mine has already been working at Compass, then-recently acquired by Sage. My duty was
            pretty much anything they threw at my way. Navigating the microservice-backed infrastructure was both
            fun and intellectually challenging.

          <p>
            Over the course of 3 months, I ended up performing marketing research, user interview, UI/UX design
            and development on a feature improvements serving thousands of merchants with $13B+ USD in gross
            merchandise volume.

            I spent 6 years in the University, one-sixth of the time I was with EventXtra. My adventure at
            EventXtra has been amazing. It was fun working with colleagues full of characters and excellent
            at their own domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps what I learned the most aside from all technical stuff was how to be a decent person
            at work and in the sociality. The
            <a href="https://blog.tommyku.com/special/leaving-eventxtra-with-26-lessons-learned/">26 lessons I learned at EventXtra</a>
            has been posted on my blog. I am grateful for having worked at EventXtra as the experience
            in EventXtra hugely influenced my career choice and personal development.

            I worked at EventXtra for 13 months in total, with 3 months of exchange at UC Davis, CA in between.
            Unlike some companies where interns do the most tedious tasks. I was tasked to fix bugs on the first
            week, and to build features since the second week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a list of features I proudly owned, meaning either I was the person developing it, or
            that I was the major contributor:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Event registration renovation</li>
            <li>Multi-user permission system</li>
            <li>Two-step authentication, you can <a href="https://blog.tommyku.com/blog/integrating-two-step-two-factor-authentication-into-rails-4-project-with-devise/">find out more</a> on my blog</li>
            <li>Form builder for membership registration</li>
            <li>Payment integration</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I also fixed multiple old bugs and increased test case coverage to 90%+. Other times, we
            were collaborating to fix bugs for new features and improve upon the existing features.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other times, we had weekly technical team sharing featuring techs that we wish to adopt
            into the team, or just for pure fun. I even had the chance to built a <a href="https://blog.tommyku.com/blog/think-about-the-physical-web/">Physical web</a>
            prototype out of some spare hardware and presented it to the founder and the marketing
            team.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            Tommy has strong technical skills. Although he was an intern in the company, he contributed
            quite a lot of ideas on team culture, products, and technical best practices. Quite an
            all-rounded technical person.

            When EventXtra was selected by the accelerator AppWorks, I travelled with another engineer and the
            co-founder to Taipen for a month. The experience spawned some productivity-related food for thought,
            which you may check out in <a href="https://blog.tommyku.com/blog/working-in-taipei-for-a-month/">this post</a>.

            As a startup with a rather small headcount (consistently less than 20 people) but hugely diversified
            backgounds, I developed close friendships with my teammates I found valuable in personal development.
            They showed me new perspectives of thinking and inspired me with demonstrated excellence in their
            respective fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            I see my experience in EventXtra a major turning point in my university life. From an arrogant and naive
            person to someone trusted and befriend by many. The connections I developed has been useful in my career
            even today, and probably will continue to be well into the future.

            In the winter of 2015, I simply found it too hard to stay at home for a whole month without do anything.
            A quick web search led me to Ikky, a Hong Kong-based startup. My relationship with Ikky extended beyond
            the initial 2-3 week of internship, to a part-time developer for 3 months afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ikky was my first taste of startup in Hong Kong. Looking back, I am still shocked by how company
            culture could largely impact employee morale, productivity and turnover rate.

            I worked at Ikky primarily to develop test cases for their RESTful API using Node.js. Impressed by
            the structured workflow and elegance of test driven development, I continued to employ TDD whenever
            the application means serious business. Advocating TDD has attracted me quite some attentions in my later
            employment as well.
